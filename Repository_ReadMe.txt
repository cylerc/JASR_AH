ReadMe file for: Arroyo Hondo Pueblo Turkey Analysis and Scanning Electron Microscope Data by Cyler Conrad, Emily Lena Jones, Seth D. Newsome and Douglas W. Schwartz (2015). 

Data folder: 

ahNISP.csv

This .csv file includes transcribed faunal data based on the number of identified specimen counts in Lang and Harris (1984) for Arroyo Hondo. It is used in the associated R code (found in the R Script folder). 

fig6a.csv, fig6b.csv and fig7.csv are created in R and use faunal data from the ahNISP.csv 

R Script: 

All R script (code) used in this analysis is provided as an R markdown (Rmd) file titled: ah.Rmd

Manuscript Figures folder:

This folder contains raw manuscript figures created using R. 

Scanning Electron Microscope Images folder:

This folder contains all supplemental scanning electron microscope images not included in the manuscript. Captions are provided here:
